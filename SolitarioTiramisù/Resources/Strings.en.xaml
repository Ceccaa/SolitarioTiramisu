    <sys:String x:Key="GameRules">GAME RULES:</sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="RulesText">Building the foundations: Cards can be moved to the foundations only in ascending order and by the same suit.
    Moving cards in the tableau: Cards can be moved between sequences if they have the same suit as the top card. 
    The value of the card does not matter in this case. Any card can be placed on an empty sequence.
    Remaining deck: The deck is dealt four cards at a time.
    The dealt cards can be used to build the foundations or moved between sequences in the tableau.</sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="EndOfGame">END OF GAME:</sys:String>
    <sys:String x:Key="EndText">You can go through the deck twice: the game ends when all the cards are in the foundations in ascending order by the same suit. 
    If there are no more possible moves and the foundations are not complete at the end of the second pass through the deck, the game is considered lost.</sys:String>
